### Notes on getting histone modification data from ENCODE

We want h3k27ac and h3k04me3 from as many cell lines as possible
Should use the peaks and the signal track?
We have data from 
	Broad: http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/encodeDCC/wgEncodeBroadHistone/ AND http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgFileUi?db=hg19&g=wgEncodeBroadHistone
	Stanford: http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/encodeDCC/wgEncodeSydhHistone/ AND http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgFileUi?db=hg19&g=wgEncodeSydhHistone
	UW: http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/encodeDCC/wgEncodeUwHistone/ AND http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgFileUi?db=hg19&g=wgEncodeUwHistone
